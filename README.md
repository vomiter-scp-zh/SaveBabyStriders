Do you feel bad for baby striders shievering on their parent's back? Worry no more. This mod makes them able to feel the warmth from their parents, as long as their parent is warm as well.

In vanilla minecraft, striders can only be warmed by the block directly beneath them. Because of that, strider babies spawned on the back of another adult strider will have to suffer. The only way to ease their pain was to kill them or kill the parent. With this mod, you don't have to watch such tragedy happen at vast lava lakes in the nether anymore. Babies and their parent can live happily and warmly there.
